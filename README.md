# IIoT Shop Air Monitor
An inexpensive, IIoT connected alternative to traditional industrial stack lights and pressure switches. 

## Overview
Traditionally we used a simple pressure switch and a stacklight for a visual indication of the shop air pressure status. The cost is roughly $500 per unit. For under $100 the stack light can be replaced by a Neopixel matrix and the pressure switch with a pressure transducer capable of reporting to an MQTT broker or MODBUS TCP master over WiFi.
