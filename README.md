# IIoT Shop Air Monitor
An inexpensive, IIoT connected alternative to traditional industrial stack lights and pressure switches. 

## Overview
Typically you'd use a simple pressure switch and a stacklight for a visual indication of the shop air pressure status. The cost is over $500 per unit. 

For under $100 the stack light can be replaced by a Neopixel matrix and the pressure switch with a 0-10V pressure transducer.  A WiFi capable Arduino style microcontroller adds the ability to report to an MQTT broker or a MODBUS TCP master.
